/**
 * A failed connect must cost ONE call, not the process.
 *
 * `ready` used to be assigned once in the constructor and never reassigned, so a rejected
 * `connect()` left a permanently REJECTED promise that every method awaited for the life of the
 * object. Per-turn construction hid that -- a blip cost exactly one turn, and the next turn built a
 * fresh client -- but run-turn.ts now memoises ONE backend process-wide, which turns the same
 * transient failure into a permanent outage for every remaining turn the worker serves.
 *
 * `connect()` really can reject, and both common shapes do: probed against the pinned redis@6.2.1, a
 * refused connect rejects with `ECONNREFUSED` and a black-holed SYN rejects with
 * `ConnectionTimeoutError` once the 5s default `connectTimeout` fires. (The socket schedules its own
 * background retry in both cases, but the attempt this promise represents is already lost, which is
 * what the re-arm is about.) In a cluster the second is the COMMON transient shape: a Service with no
 * ready endpoints, or a NetworkPolicy drop, black-holes the SYN instead of refusing it.
 *
 * The `redis` module is mocked rather than pointed at a dead port because a black-holed address costs
 * 5s per attempt and depends on the network answering with silence rather than ICMP.
 *
 * This file proves the BOOKKEEPING only. Its mock is a plain object, so it cannot emit -- the crash
 * this re-arm was once thought to prevent lives on the event channel and is pinned separately, in
 * `redis-error-listener.test.ts`.
 *
 * The last case is the exception that proves the rule: node-redis's terminal give-up is reached THROUGH
 * the event channel, but its consequence is a plain state flip (`isOpen` false, `ready` still resolved),
 * so it is observable here without emitting anything. That flip is the whole reason `open()` cannot
 * re-arm on a rejected promise alone.
