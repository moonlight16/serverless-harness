/**
 * A client that loses its socket must not take the worker with it.
 *
 * node-redis clients are EventEmitters, and `RedisSocket.#onSocketError` re-emits every socket error
 * on the client -- so with no `'error'` listener an established connection dropping is an uncaught
 * exception and Node exits 1. Probed on the pinned `redis@6.2.1` with `CLIENT KILL` against the
 * probe's own connection: no listener exits on an uncaught `SocketClosedUnexpectedlyError`, one
 * listener handles it and node-redis reconnects by itself.
 *
 * `redis-backend-rearm.test.ts` cannot see this: its mock is a plain object, so nothing ever emits.
 * This mock is a real EventEmitter for exactly that reason.
 *
 * The failure needs no in-flight turn to blame, which is what makes it worse here than it was: the
 * store is memoised for the process's life (run-turn.ts `sharedSessionStore`), so a Redis restart
 * while a worker sits idle is enough.
