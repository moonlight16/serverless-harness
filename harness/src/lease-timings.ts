 * The clamp is the part nothing enforced before. `heartbeatMs` and `ttlMs` were independent knobs, so
 * `KAGENTI_SANDBOX_LEASE_TTL_MS=15000` on its own expired the lease before its first renewal: the
 * sandbox returned to the pool mid-turn, and another turn could then take the same pod past cap.
