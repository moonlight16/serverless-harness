/**
 * A lease handle held as a CLOSURE must survive the shared store being dropped.
 *
 * `selectPoolSandbox` returns `heartbeat`/`release` closures, and every caller keeps them for the
 * life of the turn or leaf — `run-leaf.ts`'s three `setInterval`s and `run-turn.ts`'s renewal all
 * tick on them long after `selectPoolSandbox` returned. `sharedLease`'s wrapper used to bind one
 * store instance at construction, so those closures could not benefit from the memo's own recovery:
 *
 *  1. a command rejects (a Redis blip, or `ClientClosedError` past `resilientClientOptions`' bound),
 *  2. `guard` runs `dropMemo`, which CLOSES that store and nulls the memo,
 *  3. the next `selectPoolSandbox` builds a healthy store — but the closure still points at the
 *     closed one, whose every command now rejects `ClientClosedError` for good, and whose further
 *     drops are no-ops because `dropMemo`'s identity check sees a different memoised store.
 *
 * So a blip lasting one command cost the lease for the whole turn: heartbeats stop, the TTL lapses,
 * and the pod returns to the pool while the turn is still executing inside it — over-subscribing the
 * soft cap `ACQUIRE_LUA` exists to enforce. It also made every later tick a fresh rejection, which
 * is what turned an unguarded `void lease.heartbeat()` from a one-off into a process-killer.
 *
 * The fix is that the wrapper resolves the memo PER CALL, so a captured closure re-enters exactly as
 * a fresh `sharedLease()` caller would. Giving `RedisLeaseStore` the `arm()`/`open()` re-arm its
 * siblings have would NOT achieve this: `dropMemo` deliberately closed that client, and node-redis
 * lets `connect()` reopen a closed one (probed on the pinned redis 6.2.1 — `close()` then
 * `connect()` returns `isOpen: true` and PINGs), so the closure would resurrect a store no memo
 * references and nothing will ever close. This suite pins both halves: the closure recovers, and the
 * dropped store stays dropped.
