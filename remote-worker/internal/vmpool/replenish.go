// DELAYED, NOT IMMEDIATE, and spec §4.4 is worth restating because the number is
// large: every Exec schedules a replenishment, so an unconditional refill hands D
// fresh standbys to a run at the exact moment it stops issuing work. At 256 MiB
// guests, D=2 and ~100 runs finishing in five minutes that is ~50 GiB of memory
// spent on VMs that will never serve a command. A run's next Exec is separated by a
// model round trip of hundreds of ms, so a 200ms delay still completes well before
// it arrives.
//
// It cannot take the residual to zero. A dispatch's LAST wire event is
// cleanupWorkspace (converge.ts:44-51) — an Exec like any other, indistinguishable
// from work — so the pool pops a standby, refreshes the idle clock and schedules a
// refill for a run that is already over. StandbyIdle ages that remainder out; only
// spec §9's Release removes it, and §7.3's idle-standby-residency metric is what
// measures it.
