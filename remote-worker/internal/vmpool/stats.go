	// reaper's queue was full -- i.e. teardowns that paid today's synchronous cost anyway.
	// Nonzero means the reaper is saturated, which is the first thing to check when a
	// deferral arm measures flat: the arm was partly not applied.
	ReapsInline uint64
	// BarrierUnobserved counts teardowns whose descriptor barrier could not be read, each of
	// which fell back to reaping synchronously under execGate. A SEPARATE reason from
	// ReapsInline, and separate from DestroyFailures: the destroy succeeded, it just did not
	// get to be deferred. Folding it into DestroyFailures made one VM contribute twice when
	// its barrier was unreadable AND its reap then failed, which over-reports against the VM
	// count -- the ratio you would use to decide whether the fallback is firing.
	BarrierUnobserved uint64
	// TimeoutsClamped counts Execs whose timeout_s this package had to bound
	// (clampTimeoutS): absent/zero, or above MaxExecTimeoutS. A nonzero and growing
	// figure is a caller-side fact, not a pool fault — most likely a relay that omits
	// the field — and it is the only visibility on it after the first log line.
