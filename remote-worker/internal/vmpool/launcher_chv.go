// This file is the Cloud Hypervisor arm of Launcher (spec §3.5, §4.3, §6), the
// second VMM behind the same seam launcher_firecracker.go implements. It is
// modelled on that file deliberately — same process-lifetime discipline (Restore
// uses exec.Command, not exec.CommandContext, and hands the *exec.Cmd to the
// returned VM so Destroy, not ctx cancellation, ends its life), same
// errors.Join-based cleanup-on-every-failure-path convention, same idempotent
// Destroy — because this is a second arm, not a second style.
//
// THE ONE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE FROM FIRECRACKER: virtio-fs. The workspace here is
// not a guest-owned ext4 block device but a HOST directory arbitrated by virtiofsd,
// so (a) there are TWO host processes per standby, not one (cloud-hypervisor and
// its own virtiofsd — spec §7.3's "Σ PSS across VMM + virtiofsd"), and (b) the host
// filesystem, not a device mount, is the concurrency authority: SerializesExecsPerRun
// is false, D>1 standbys are safe, and Run mounts (fresh, every Exec, in its own
// command wrapper — round 8) but never syncs (see Run's comment). The no-sync half
// of that asymmetry with Task 15 is the trade spec §4.3 prices, not an omission; the
// mount half is not optional — round 7's gates found writes vanishing between Execs
// because nothing mounted the device virtio-fs merely attaches (task-16 report,
// round 8).
//
// CONFINEMENT GAP THIS FILE DOES NOT CLOSE (named per hardware-corrections C5):
// the cloud-hypervisor process itself runs UNCHROOTED on this arm. Firecracker gets
// jailer's chroot; Cloud Hypervisor has no jailer equivalent, and
// `systemd-run --scope` (the tutorial's own §8 proposal) reproduces jailer's cgroup
// behaviour but bundles no chroot, no --uid/--gid, nothing like jailer's
// hardlink-into-the-jail convention. virtiofsd itself DOES have a chroot/namespace
// mechanism (--sandbox=chroot|namespace, used below) so the narrower true gap is
// just the VMM process. Spec §5.3 expects an equivalent for it; Task 17 owns
// supplying the per-arm confinement/cgroup mechanism split, not this task. This is
// verified and known, not a guess: it was confirmed against a real cloud-hypervisor
// v53.0 restore on the rig rather than inferred from documentation.
//
// TASK 17'S DISPOSITION OF C5 (D3/D4, hardware-corrections): D3 — the cgroup half —
// IS closed below: chvSystemdRunScopeArgv wraps the cloud-hypervisor exec in
// `systemd-run --scope --slice=<the same slice Firecracker's jailer --parent-cgroup
// targets> -p MemoryMax=<vmpool.PerVMBytes(cfg)>`, giving this arm the same per-VM
// cgroup and memory.max bound jailer gives Firecracker's, from the same
// single-source-of-truth function (config.go's PerVMBytes) so the two arms cannot
// drift apart (spec §5.3). `--scope` was chosen specifically because it execs the
// target IN PLACE of the systemd-run client process rather than forking a detached
// unit (confirmed against systemd-run(1): "the invoked process is run as part of
// the scope unit... rather than as a child process of systemd-run"), so
// vmmCmd.Process.Pid, fcKillProcessGroup(pid), and vmmCmd.Wait() below all keep
// working unmodified — the single most safety-critical property this whole file
// has (Destroy must always be able to kill and reap what Restore started) is
// intended to be preserved exactly, on the strength of that documented
// exec-in-place behaviour. Round 12 (task-16 report) went looking for ground
// truth beyond the man page and could not get it: a captured hang showed
// cloud-hypervisor and virtiofsd both alive under `systemd-run --scope`, which
// is CONSISTENT with this claim but is not PROOF of it — the same observation is
// equally consistent with systemd-run remaining a distinct, still-alive parent
// that relocated the child into the scope's cgroup by some other means (e.g.
// clone()+cgroup-migrate, then blocking as a supervisor) rather than execve(2)
// in place. This file still has no host with systemd + KVM to tell the two
// apart, so this claim remains unverified end to end, not merely "unverified" as
// a formality. The round 12 fix (chvLogPath below) was deliberately designed to
// NOT depend on it being true: cloud-hypervisor is told its own --log-file path
// directly in its own argv, so its own words land in a file CH itself opens and
// writes, regardless of which process Go's exec.Cmd directly spawned or whether
// that process's stdout/stderr fds are the ones CH ends up inheriting.
//
// D4 — the chroot/filesystem-isolation half — is DELIBERATELY NOT closed here,
// and this is a reasoned finding, not a silent gap. The one mechanism that could
// close it without hand-rolled Go-level mount-namespace code is switching from
// `systemd-run --scope` to a transient systemd *service* (drop --scope), because
// only a full service unit's execution context grants access to systemd's
// filesystem-sandboxing properties (RootDirectory=, ProtectSystem=strict,
// BindPaths=/BindReadOnlyPaths=, DeviceAllow=/dev/kvm rw with PrivateDevices=yes,
// NoNewPrivileges=yes) — a --scope unit only relocates an already-running process
// into a cgroup and applies none of those. But a transient service forks
// asynchronously and is reaped by the systemd manager, not by this process, so
// keeping our foreground exec.Cmd handle synchronized with it would require one of
// systemd-run's --pipe/--wait/--collect flags, whose exact interaction with
// signal delivery and process-group membership this task has no real Linux host
// with systemd + KVM to verify. Getting that interaction wrong would silently
// break exactly the property D3 above was careful to preserve: sending SIGKILL to
// vmmCmd's own pid would kill the systemd-run client but NOT the systemd-managed
// service process tree it detached from, so Destroy would report success having
// killed nothing — reintroducing, for this arm, the precise "worker crash leaks
// VMs" failure spec §6 names as the #1 practical failure this whole task exists to
// prevent, except now on ordinary Destroy rather than only on a crash. Shipping
// that unverified is a worse outcome than shipping the already-disclosed gap: a
// known, named absence versus a confinement mechanism that looks correct in argv
// construction and quietly defeats cleanup in production. Closing D4 properly is
// left as a follow-up that needs hardware verification, not a code change made
// blind.

//     hardware probing (three runs, one variable at a time) found it INCOMPATIBLE with
//     the non-root requirement immediately above: opening a file handle for the shared
//     directory's root node requires CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH, which a process that has
//     dropped to VirtiofsdUID/GID (an unprivileged uid, e.g. 65534) does not have —
//     confirmed by virtiofsd's own README ("and CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH if
//     --inode-file-handles is used" / "virtiofsd can't use file handles ... requires
//     CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH"). At uid 65534 with --inode-file-handles=mandatory,
//     virtiofsd logs "Failed to open file handle for the root node: Operation not
//     permitted (os error 1)", refuses to start ("Refusing to use (mandatory) file
//     handles, as they do not appear safe to use"), and exits — which is why Restore's
//     "virtiofsd socket never appeared" error was the shape this failed in on the rig.
//     At uid 65534 WITHOUT the flag, or at root WITH it, virtiofsd starts fine: the
//     flag and the unprivileged uid are what conflict, not --sandbox=namespace (C2,
//     confirmed separately and unchanged) and not the directory traversal fix from
//     Task 18 (also confirmed separately).
//
//     Spec §3.5 decides which requirement yields, and it is not close: with virtio-fs,
//     guest path resolution happens in virtiofsd ON THE HOST, so virtiofsd IS the
//     confinement boundary for the whole design — a root virtiofsd compromise is host
//     root and would render the microVM boundary decorative. That is a boundary
//     collapse. What mandatory file handles buy is narrower: they let virtiofsd
//     reference inodes by handle rather than by path, closing certain rename/symlink
//     TOCTOU race classes inside the shared directory. Losing them is a real but
//     bounded reduction in hardening against a guest racing paths in its own
//     workspace — trading that for avoiding a boundary collapse is the right
//     direction. This is a deliberate, evidenced downgrade, not an oversight: if you
//     are reading --sandbox=namespace here with no file-handle flag and wondering
//     whether the hardening was simply forgotten, it was not — see above.
//
//     Chose --inode-file-handles=prefer, explicit rather than omitted, over virtiofsd's
//     own bare "never". virtiofsd's README documents three values (never, prefer,
//     mandatory) and states prefer as its own default — "attempt to generate file
//     handles, but fall back to O_PATH file descriptors where ... CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH
//     is not available" — which matches the coordinator's observed degrade-and-continue
//     log line ("File handles do not appear safe to use, disabling file handles
//     altogether") when the flag is left off entirely. Passing it explicitly, rather
//     than leaning on virtiofsd's unstated default, keeps the actual policy visible in
//     this argv rather than one version bump away from silently changing; "prefer"
//     rather than "never" costs nothing at VirtiofsdUID/GID and still gets file

// virtiofsd must traverse into and serve it, so a directory it cannot enter
// fails identically to a socket it cannot create.
//
// This does NOT reach workspaceDir's ANCESTORS. Firecracker's UID/GID needs no
// analogous fix there because it only ever touches paths *inside* its own
// jail (a directory tree it created and chowns as it goes, exactly like
// runDir here); virtio-fs is different because virtiofsd serves req.WorkspaceDir
// directly rather than a copy hardlinked under a launcher-owned root, so its
// own ancestor chain is out of this launcher's control — it belongs to
// whatever created WorkspaceDir (the pool/orchestration layer), the same class
// of assumption this file already makes about RunDir's and SnapshotDir's own
// parents being reachable.
//
// Review finding (fix round 11): the chown above was, on its own, an
// INCOMPLETE guarantee for runDir specifically. Chown changes ownership only —
// it says nothing about the mode bits, which up to this fix rested entirely on
// the mode argument Restore's own os.MkdirAll(runDir, 0o700) call passed when
// it FIRST created runDir. That argument is a no-op the moment runDir already
// exists (MkdirAll never chmods a pre-existing directory), and nothing after
// creation ever independently re-asserted or verified it — unlike
// workspaceDir, which already had BOTH an active fix (this chown) AND an
// independent verification (chvCheckWorkspaceReachable, fix round 3) before
// this round. runDir had only the active half of that pattern. The hardware
// repro this fix round starts from — virtiofsd's "Error creating pid file
// '<socket>.pid': Permission denied" — is exactly what an owner-writable
// assumption silently failing looks like: virtiofsd needs to WRITE a new
// directory entry (the socket, and the .pid file it creates beside it) into
// runDir, not merely traverse it, so this chmod closes the same kind of gap
// for runDir's own mode that fix round 1 already closed for its ownership.
// chmod, deliberately, only ever targets runDir here, never workspaceDir:
// workspaceDir is the pool/orchestration layer's directory, not this
// launcher's own, and this file already treats it as off-limits for anything
// beyond chown (see the "does NOT reach workspaceDir's ANCESTORS" paragraph
// above) — actively rewriting its mode bits would be the same overreach one
// level down.

// rewriteSnapshotConfig returns a copy of the golden snapshot's config.json with
// its embedded vsock socket path, (if present) virtio-fs socket path, and every
// disk's path replaced by host-resolvable ones.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (a design decision this task made, not one the brief or
// hardware-corrections prescribe a mechanism for): the reference tutorial
// documents that config.json embeds the vsock socket path VERBATIM, and that
// restoring the SAME snapshot without removing the stale socket collides —
// "Cannot create virtio-vsock backend", "Error binding to the host-side Unix
// socket" (errno 98, address in use) — because "whichever process restores it
// recreates that path". The tutorial's own fix (rm -f the stale socket) only
// covers SEQUENTIAL restores where the first VM is already dead; it does not
// cover TWO LIVE standbys restored from the identical config.json at once, which
// is exactly what TestCloudHypervisorSupportsTwoStandbysForOneRun exercises.
// hardware-corrections C8 anticipates needing exactly this: "If that test
// nonetheless fails, the disk lock is not your cause; look at ... the vsock
// socket path, or the snapshot's own config.json." This function, plus Restore's
// per-VM directory below, is this task's answer to that hint.
//
// Fix round 7 EXTENDS this to disks[].path, for a DIFFERENT reason than vsock/fs:
// vsock and fs sockets vary PER VM (each standby needs its own, or they collide).
// disks[].path does not vary per VM at all — every standby is rewritten to the
// exact SAME absolute host path, filepath.Join(SnapshotDir, fileRootfs) — every
// standby shares the one golden rootfs file, unconditionally. The reason it still
// needs rewriting is different: build-snapshot.sh's CH arm builds the golden
// snapshot chrooted into a jail, so config.json's disks[].path is recorded
// JAIL-RELATIVE ("/rootfs") — meaningless once this launcher restores it
// unchrooted (a documented gap this file's package comment attributes to Task
// 17), where "/rootfs" resolves against the HOST's real root, and nothing lives
// there. ch-remote restore's own error on real hardware is exact about this:
// "Cannot open disk path","I/O error (path=/rootfs op=open)","No such file or
// directory (os error 2)".
//
// THIS IS NOT A REVERSAL of the earlier "disks is deliberately left untouched"
// decision — that decision was, and remains, about disks[].readonly, not
// disks[].path, and the two must not be conflated:
//   - readonly stays exactly as the golden snapshot's own config.json already has
//     it (readonly=on, baked in by build-snapshot.sh's own
//     `--disk "path=/rootfs,readonly=on"`). This launcher still never sets or
//     forces it. C4/C8 already confirmed readonly=on gives the rootfs a
//     SharedRead advisory lock, and SharedRead locks coexist — verified directly
//     on the rig (a writable open was refused with "Can't get Write lock ... as
//     there is already a SharedRead lock", while a readonly one was not), which
//     is what lets N standbys open the one golden rootfs concurrently. That is a
//     build-pipeline concern; this launcher's argv is still silent on it.
//   - path IS rewritten, because it is a RESTORER-side concern the golden
//     snapshot cannot itself resolve: it was recorded relative to a jail
//     directory structure ($jail as "/") that no longer exists once the snapshot
//     is copied out and restored somewhere else, unchrooted. Something on the
//     restore side has to translate it back to a real, absolute, host path —
//     exactly the same class of problem vsock.socket already had, and exactly why
//     this function is where the fix belongs. No staging or per-VM copy is
//     needed: every standby is handed the identical absolute path, on purpose.
//
// Audit of other config.json fields that might carry a similar jail-relative
// path — walking build-snapshot.sh's CH-arm jail invocation (--kernel /kernel,
// --disk path=/rootfs, --vsock socket=/vsock.sock, --console
// file=/console.log) against Cloud Hypervisor v53.0's own vmm/src/vm_config.rs
// and vmm/src/lib.rs. THIS SECTION WAS WRONG ONCE (round 7) AND HAS BEEN
// CORRECTED (round 13) — see the task-16 report's fix-round-13 section for the
// full story of how, and why the correction rests on the daemon's own log
// rather than on source reading a second time:
//
//   - payload.kernel ("/kernel"): round 7 concluded this was "safe (never
//     re-read on restore — snapshot.is_none() gate)", reasoning from
//     vmm/src/vm.rs's load_payload_async call site. THIS WAS WRONG. The
//     coordinator's captured CH log, mid-hang, showed CH logging "Booting VM
//     from config" — with payload.kernel: Some("/kernel") still present — while
//     servicing a VmRestore API call, i.e. the code path that reconstructs a
//     restored VM's config DOES carry this field forward and does act on it
//     though. It does not exist on the host, because this launcher deliberately
//     does not chroot (this file's package comment, hardware-corrections C5).
//     THE lesson (stated because it generalizes beyond this one field): source
//     reading told round 7 which code path SHOULD run; the daemon's own log
//     told round 13 which code path DID run. When those disagree, the log
//     wins. Now rewritten to the golden kernel's absolute host path,
//     filepath.Join(SnapshotDir, fileKernel) — exactly the same treatment as
//     disks[].path already got in round 7, for the identical reason: every
//     standby shares the one golden kernel file, unconditionally, so this is
//     not per-VM-unique the way vsock/fs sockets are.
//   - console.file ("/console.log"): round 7's read of this field's BLOCKING
//     behavior was correct (File::create succeeds against a nonexistent host
//     "/console.log", so this was never what hung Restore) and remains
//     correct — the coordinator's round-13 log confirms CH got well past this
//     point. Round 7 also correctly flagged it as "a real but separate
//     non-blocking latent defect (host-root pollution)" and left it unfixed on
//     purpose, as out of that round's scope. Round 13 fixes it now, while
//     already in this function for payload.kernel: rewritten into the per-VM
//     run directory (chvGuestConsoleLog) instead of the host's real root.
//   - vsock.socket, fs[].socket, disks[].path: already handled, above.
//
// THE SET IS NOW CLOSED, as of round 13, verified against the coordinator's
// OWN real config dump (not against source inference — the round-7 approach
// this round is explicitly correcting): every field in that dump that could
// possibly hold a host path has been enumerated and disposed of.
//   - memory, disks[].readonly/image_type, fs[].tag/num_queues/queue_size,
//     vsock.cid: not paths.
//   - rng.src ("/dev/urandom"): IS a host path, and is left untouched
//     deliberately, not by omission — unlike every path this function does
//     rewrite, "/dev/urandom" is not jail-relative and not per-VM: it resolves
//     to the same real host device inside or outside any chroot, so there is
//     nothing here for a restore-side rewrite to fix.
//   - serial: mode is "Off" in this build (--serial off), so no file field is
//     even present in config.json to rewrite.
//   - initramfs: None in this build; not present in config.json at all.
//   - No other VmConfig field (net, pmem, devices, vdpa, numa, etc.) is
//     configured by build-snapshot.sh's CH arm at all, so none of them appear
//     in the golden config.json to begin with.
//
// UNVERIFIED END TO END: this task has no KVM access, so this rewrite has been
// exercised only as a pure function against synthetic JSON (see
// launcher_chv_test.go), never against a real config.json or a real restore.
// Round 12's capture fix is what will tell the coordinator, from the daemon's
// own words, whether this round's two rewrites actually clear the hang.

	//     comment above, now updated): systemd-run's own pre-exec announcement
	//     ("Running scope as unit: ...") lands here for certain; whether
	//     cloud-hypervisor's later writes ALSO land here depends on the still-
	//     unverified claim that --scope execs in place preserving inherited fds.
	//     This file was previously named "console.log", which round 12 renamed
	//     specifically so it stops reading as the same thing as the GUEST's own
	//     console (config.json's console.common.file — see this function's other
	//     doc comment on rewriteSnapshotConfig, a wholly separate, already-disclosed
	//     latent defect, not touched here).
	//
	//   - chvLogPath ("cloud-hypervisor.log"): passed to cloud-hypervisor itself via
	//     its own --log-file flag (confirmed against cloudhypervisor.org's CLI
	//     reference: "--log-file <log-file> Log file. Standard error is used if not
	//     specified"), plus -v for verbosity. Cloud-hypervisor opens and writes this
	//     file ITSELF, by its own path argument, independent of which process Go
	//     directly spawned and independent of whether that process's stdio fds are
	//     the ones CH inherits. This is what makes CH's own words legible in a
	//     failure regardless of how the still-unverified systemd-run --scope
	//     exec-in-place claim turns out — round 12 was explicitly about making the

//
//  1. WHERE the mount happens, and how often. Firecracker mounts once, in Resume,
//     because mounting a real block device also re-reads its metadata (spec §4.3)
//     and a Firecracker VM never shares its disk with another guest. Cloud
//     Hypervisor's virtio-fs mount is instead embedded HERE, in Run's own single
//     command, redone on every Exec: whether a virtio-fs session survives
//     snapshot/restore with its backing socket redirected to a fresh per-VM
//     virtiofsd (rewriteSnapshotConfig's fs[].socket rewrite) is unverified, and
//     this codebase already documents the analogous failure shape for vsock —
//     established connections do not survive resume, only listening ones do
//     (runOverConn's doc comment) — so a mount baked into the golden snapshot is no
//     more trusted to have survived restore than a connection would be. Embedding
//     it in Run's own round-trip, rather than a separate Resume-time call, also
//     means there is no window where Resume could report success on a mount that
//     silently didn't take.
//
//  2. NO sync. This is the one deliberate, load-bearing asymmetry with Firecracker's
//     wrapCommand that this file's package comment and Run's own comment already
//     call out: virtio-fs writes land on the HOST filesystem the moment the guest
//     issues them, so there is no guest page cache standing between a write and
//     durability the way there is for Firecracker's ext4 workspace image. Adding a
//     sync here would be cargo-culted from the other arm, not a fix for anything
//     this arm actually has wrong.
//
// Idempotency: this does NOT check "already mounted" and skip if so, the way
// Firecracker's Resume does (`mountpoint -q /workspace || mount ...`). That check
// is safe for Firecracker because its workspace is a directly-attached block device
// with no daemon in the loop — an already-mounted /workspace is trivially still
// correct there. Cloud Hypervisor's mount is backed by a per-VM virtiofsd reached
// over a socket rewriteSnapshotConfig rewrites on every single restore; a
// /workspace that LOOKS already mounted (e.g. carried in the golden snapshot's
// captured guest state) could be a stale session pointed at a virtiofsd that no
// longer exists — which is precisely the "lost write" failure round 8 exists to
// fix, not a state safe to leave alone. So this unmounts first (tolerating "not
