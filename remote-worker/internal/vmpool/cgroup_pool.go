// cgroupPool hands out reusable per-VM cgroups instead of creating and destroying one per VM.
//
// WHY. Task 3.1 decomposed Destroy and found the per-VM cgroup rmdir at 2.15 ms / 15.53 ms /
// 195.52 ms for 4 / 16 / 64 concurrency slots -- 91x growth, and 77% of Destroy at the top,
// because cgroup removal is kernel-serialised. Two cheaper fixes were measured and rejected:
// deferring the rmdir conserves the time into Acquire and makes 64 slots worse, and reclaiming
// charges before rmdir hangs worker startup. The churn also parks 12,400+ dying cgroups, which
// degraded the rig ~24% at 64 slots over one session. Not creating them addresses both.
//
// HOW IT IS POSSIBLE. jailer's --cgroup memory.max= is what CREATES the per-VM cgroup;
// --parent-cgroup alone only relocates the jailed process into a cgroup that already exists. So
// the pool creates the cgroup and writes the bound, and jailer is given only --parent-cgroup.
//
// A FREE LIST, NOT A SIZED POOL. There is no slot concept in this package to size one from --
// nextIDLocked mints ids from a monotonic counter and concurrency is bounded by admitLocked -- so
// acquire pops or mints and release pushes back, which makes the high-water mark exactly the peak
// concurrent VM count (~68 at 64 slots, against ~26,000 create/destroy cycles per rung) without
// anything having to predict it.
//
// THE MEMORY BOUND IS KEPT (design note §4, option D). A live VM cgroup charges ~1 MiB against a
// 288 MiB memory.max -- measured, 0 of 306 samples anywhere near the limit -- because the golden
// snapshot's memfile is mlocked by the WORKER at startup and hardlinked so it stays one shared
// page-cache object. A reused cgroup therefore inherits ~1 MiB, not ~400 MiB, and D1's bound
// survives reuse unchanged.

	// mkdir fails and rolls back to 6, C then takes 6 and mkdirAllCgroup returns NIL because the
	// directory already exists. Two VMMs would share one memory.max -- D1 inverted, since admission
	// control charged twice for one enforced bound. An int is free; a name is not. Making the
	// rollback safe would mean holding mu across the mkdir, serialising the syscall this change
	// exists to keep off the critical path.
